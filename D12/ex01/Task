Files to turn in : Makefile, and files needed for your program
Allowed functions : close, open, read, write
Remarks : n/a
======================================================================================
• Create a program called ft_cat which does the same thing as the system’s cat
command-line.

• You don’t have to handle options.

• The submission directory should have a Makefile with the following rules : all,
clean, fclean.

• You may use the variable errno (check the man for Errno).

• You can only do this exercise by declaring a fixed-sized array. This array will have
a size limited to a little less than 30 kb. In order to test that size-limit, use the
limit command-line in your Shell.
	$> limit stacksize 32
	$> limit stacksize
	stacksize 32 kbytes
	$>
